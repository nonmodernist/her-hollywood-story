# GitHub Pages SPA Routing Solution

Since GitHub Pages doesn't serve custom 404.html files for subdirectory routes, we need to use **hash-based routing** for the SPA to work properly.

## The Solution: Hash-Based Routing

Instead of:
- `https://nonmodernist.com/adapted-from-women/site/database/film/the-bat-1926`

We'll use:
- `https://nonmodernist.com/adapted-from-women/site/database/#/film/the-bat-1926`

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Routing Helper Script
The `routing-helper.js` script automatically detects when someone tries to access a direct path URL and redirects them to the hash version:

```javascript
// This runs immediately when the page loads
if (needsHashRouting && isDirectDatabasePath) {
    // Convert /database/film/xyz to /database/#/film/xyz
    window.location.replace(hashBasedUrl);
}
```

### 2. Hybrid Router
The `HybridRouter` class automatically detects whether to use hash or path routing based on the environment:

- **GitHub Pages**: Uses hash routing
- **Local development**: Uses path routing (for cleaner URLs during development)
- **Future production**: Will use path routing

### 3. Update All Links
The router automatically converts all internal database links to use the appropriate format.

## How It Works

1. User visits: `site/database/film/uncle-toms-cabin-1910`
2. `routing-helper.js` detects this is GitHub Pages + database path
3. Redirects to: `site/database/#/film/uncle-toms-cabin-1910`
4. The SPA router reads the hash and shows the correct content
5. All navigation within the app uses hash-based URLs

## Benefits

- ✅ Works on GitHub Pages without any server configuration
- ✅ Maintains shareable URLs
- ✅ Supports browser back/forward navigation
- ✅ Gracefully handles direct URL access
- ✅ Can easily switch to path routing when moving to better hosting

## Testing

1. Try accessing a direct URL like `/database/film/the-bat-1926`
2. It should redirect to `/database/#/film/the-bat-1926`
3. The film detail page should load correctly
4. Browser back/forward should work
5. Sharing the URL should work

## Future Migration

When moving to Netlify/Vercel or a custom domain, simply:
1. Remove the `routing-helper.js` script
2. The HybridRouter will automatically use path routing
3. All URLs will be cleaner without the hash

This solution provides the best user experience possible within GitHub Pages' limitations while maintaining easy migration path for the future.
