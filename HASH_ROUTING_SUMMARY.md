# Summary: Hash Routing Implementation for GitHub Pages

## What We've Done

I've created a complete solution to fix the GitHub Pages SPA routing issue. Here's what's ready for you:

### 1. **New Files Created**
- `site/js/spa/modules/hybrid-router.js` - Smart router that detects GitHub Pages and uses hash routing
- `site/js/spa/routing-helper.js` - Redirects direct URLs to hash versions
- `site/js/spa/database-app-complete.js` - Your updated app with hybrid routing integrated

### 2. **Modified Files**
- `site/database/index.html` - Already updated to include the routing helper

### 3. **How to Apply the Fix**

Run this in your terminal:
```bash
cd /Users/akedwards/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/adapted-from-women-project/adapted-from-women
chmod +x apply-fix.sh
./apply-fix.sh
```

This script will:
- Backup your current database-app.js
- Apply the updated version with hash routing
- Verify all required files are in place

### 4. **Test Locally**
```bash
npm run dev
```
Then:
1. Go to `http://localhost:8000/database/`
2. Click on any film - should work normally
3. To test hash routing: Open console and run `localStorage.setItem('useHashRouting', 'true')`
4. Reload - URLs should now use hash format

### 5. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Implement hash-based routing for GitHub Pages compatibility"
git push
```

### 6. **Update Pattern Page Links**

On your Twenty-Timers page, update database links:
```html
<!-- Change this -->
<a href="../database/film/the-bat-1926">

<!-- To this -->
<a href="../database/#/film/the-bat-1926">
```

## How It Works

- **Local Development**: Uses clean URLs (`/database/film/the-bat-1926`)
- **GitHub Pages**: Uses hash URLs (`/database/#/film/the-bat-1926`)
- **Automatic Detection**: The router detects the environment and switches automatically
- **Redirect Support**: Direct URLs get redirected to hash versions on GitHub Pages

## What You Get

âœ… Working SPA on GitHub Pages  
âœ… Shareable URLs that work  
âœ… Browser back/forward navigation  
âœ… All filters and search preserved in URL
