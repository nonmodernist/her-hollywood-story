Gates was, according to Ruth Ann Alexander, among the first generation of women writers to create prairie narratives, publishing _The Biography of a Prairie Girl_ in 1902. She founded The Eleanor Gates Photo-Play Company in 1914, producing at least one film (_Doc_), and wrote titles for the film adaptation. Her work was adapted into six films between 1914 and 1936, including Mary Pickford's highly successful 1917 version of _The Poor Little Rich Girl_ and the 1936 Shirley Temple remake for which Gates received $20,000. She advocated for women's independence in her non-fiction writing and was married to playwright Richard Walton Tully (1901-1914 or 1916). Despite her commercial success, no major archive holds her papers today.",
