  "adaptation_notes": "Columbia's 1928 trade advertisements explicitly credit Elizabeth Alexander as author of the _Saturday Evening Post_ serial story, \"Trial Marriage,\" that they plan to adapt. The film features at least two characters with the same names as in the story: Constance Bannester and Thorvald Ware. However, AFI and all film sources credit only Sonya Levien with both story and screenplay. This appears to be a clear case of source author erasure.",
