Structure the narrative around these compelling themes:
Opening Hook: "Harvey Higgins wrote in 1927 that Miller's stories 'are written as precisely as if they were engraved by a fashionable stationer, but they are full of the devil.' This perfectly captures the paradox of Alice Duer Miller—a society insider who skewered high society, a light verse writer who tackled heavy politics, a 'popular' author whose work influenced American attitudes toward entering WWII."

Closing: "Miller was never a bestseller list fixture or award winner—she was something perhaps more impressive: a working writer whose name appeared constantly in major magazines for decades, who helped shape both women's suffrage and American foreign policy through accessible, witty verse and fiction."
