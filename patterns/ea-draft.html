                <p>In August 1928, Columbia Pictures paid for half-page ads declaring they owned <i>Trial Marriage</i> by Elizabeth Alexander—DULY COPYRIGHTED, all rights protected, violators liable for damages. Eight months later, the film was in theaters. So how did another writer end up with credit for Alexander's story?</p>

                <p>The story of Elizabeth Alexander's vanishing credit unfolds through a series of trade publications, advertisements, and industry records. Each document tells part of the story—and together, they reveal how a writer's name disappeared from film history.</p>

                        <p>Motion Picture News reports that Millard Webb will direct "Trial Marriage," from the Saturday Evening Post story by Elizabeth Alexander. Ben Grauman Kohn is writing the adaptation. Columbia clearly knows whose story they're filming.</p>

                        <p>When Imperial Productions releases an unrelated film called "Trial Marriage," Columbia runs defensive ads in The Film Daily. The message is unambiguous: We own Elizabeth Alexander's story. Back off.</p>

            <h2>Following the Trail: A Research Narrative</h2>
            <div class="content-medium">
                <p>I stumbled onto this mystery while researching biographical details about Alexander. I set out to find her birth and death dates, but when I ran her name through the Media History Digital Library, October 1928 ad caught my eye—Columbia was advertising their prestige literary properties, and there was Elizabeth Alexander's name. There were already four Alexander adaptations in the database, but none of them were based on <i>Trial Marriage.</i> At first I thought that perhaps the film never got made.</p>
                
                <p>But when I checked the AFI Catalog, the film existed—only Sonya Levien was credited as writer.</p>
                
                <p>Something didn't add up.</p>
                
                <p>I went back to the Media History Digital Library, this time searching for <i>Trial Marriage</i>.</p>
                
                <p>Nothing in the film copyright catalog—except wait, "Trial Marriage" WAS there, correctly crediting Alexander. So the legal record knew the truth. Why didn't the film histories?</p>
                
                <p>Working backwards from the film's release, I tracked down every mention in the trade papers. Motion Picture News, Film Daily, Harrison's Reports—throughout 1928 and early 1929, everyone knew this was Alexander's story. Columbia even took out defensive ads to protect their ownership of HER story.</p>
                
                <p>I headed over to FictionMags Index, which I use to fill in information about source works in the database that were originally published in magazines. I got very lucky at this point: not only did they have a listing for <i>Trial Marriage</i>, they had a link to the magazine on Internet Archive. I started skimming it, looking for details that I could match to a description of the film's plot.</p>
                
                <p>The character names were nearly identical.</p>
                
                <p>Another break came when I found that Film Daily Year Book entry. Somewhere between April and December 1929, Alexander's credit evaporated, replaced by Levien getting credited for both "original and adaptation." The industry press—not the film itself, not the copyright office—rewrote history.</p>
                
                <p>Each document led to another question: When did Columbia first option the story? (Still hunting for this.) What did the actual screen credits say? (The film is frustratingly rare—only one known screening at Cinecon 2009 that I'm aware of.) How did Levien's name migrate from "adaptation" to "original"?</p>
                
                <p>What I learned: Always triangulate. The copyright office knows things the AFI doesn't. Trade papers from production tell truths that year-end summaries erase. And sometimes, a studio's defensive ad becomes the best proof of what they were actually defending.</p>

            <h2>The Mysteries That Remain</h2>
            <div class="content-medium">
                <h3>The Big Question: What's on the Screen?</h3>
                <p>The most crucial evidence—the film's actual credits—remains tantalizingly out of reach. With only one known screening in recent decades (Cinecon 2009), we can't verify who the film itself credits. Does the title card name Alexander? Does it credit Levien for adaptation only, or for the story itself? Until I find someone who saw that screening, or another print surfaces, this mystery lingers.</p>
                
                <h3>Other Open Questions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When exactly did Columbia option Alexander's story? The earliest mention is June 1928, but they likely secured rights earlier.</li>
                    <li>Did Alexander know about the credit erasure? Did she protest?</li>
                    <li>How many other stories by women writers met the same fate?</li>
                    <li>Why did Levien specifically get credit for "original"—was this standard practice when adapting magazine fiction?</li>
                    <li>Are there other films where defensive copyright ads preserve the true authorship?</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
            <div class="content-medium">
                <p>This isn't just about one writer or one film. It's about how film history gets written—and rewritten.</p>
                
                <p>Columbia's own advertisements prove they knew exactly whose story they were filming. The copyright office still preserves the truth. But somewhere between the legal filing and the historical record, Elizabeth Alexander vanished. The Film Daily Year Book's false attribution became "fact," repeated by the AFI Catalog and every subsequent source.</p>
                
                <p>Without primary source research—without checking those defensive ads, those production announcements, those contemporary reviews—Alexander would remain erased. How many other writers share her fate?</p>
