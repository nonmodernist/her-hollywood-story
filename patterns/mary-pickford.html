            <div class="hero__intro">
                <p>Between 1910 and 1927, Mary Pickford starred in <strong>17
                        films</strong> adapted from
                    <strong>13 authors</strong> whose works spanned from
                    Victorian melodramas to contemporary bestsellers.
What emerges from examining these adaptations is more than a
                    filmography—it's a blueprint for how Hollywood's most
                    powerful
                    silent actress used women's literature to build her
                    multimedia stardom.</p>

            <div class="content-medium">
                <p>Mary Pickford's seventeen adaptations span an extraordinary
                    fifty years of American women's literature—from
                    Frances Hodgson Burnett's "<a
                        href="../database/work/esmeralda"
                        class="work-title.short-story">Esmeralda</a>" (1877) to Kathleen
                    Norris's

                        class="work-title">My Best Girl</a> (published and
                    filmed in 1927). But the pattern of her choices
                    reveals something more intriguing than mere range: Pickford
                    was consciously positioning herself as a bridge
                    between the Victorian stage traditions that trained her and
                    the modern medium she was helping to invent.

                <p>The Burnett adaptations stand as the most obvious example of
                    this Victorian preference. Between 1915 and 1921,
                    Pickford returned to Frances Hodgson Burnett's work four
                    times, twice through her own studio:</p>

                <h3>Seizing the Contemporary Moment</h3>
                <div class="content-medium">
                <p>But Pickford was equally adept at seizing the contemporary
                    moment. The same year she produced
                    <a class="film-title">A Little Princess</a> from 1887, she
                    grabbed Eleanor Hoyt Brainerd's
                    <a class="work-title">How Could You, Jean?</a> just one
                    year after its 1917 publication. Most remarkably,
                    she filmed <a class="film-title">The Eagle's Mate</a> and
                    <a class="film-title">My Best Girl</a> in the
                    same years they were published (1914 and 1927
                    respectively)—suggesting the studios were reading
                    galleys,
                    following serializations, or had insider publishing
                    knowledge.

                <p>This dual strategy—Victorian sentiment and contemporary
                    currency—positioned Pickford uniquely. She wasn't
                    just adapting books; she was managing time itself, bringing
                    forward what was worth preserving from the past
                    while grabbing what mattered from the present.</p>

                This role helped transform Pickford from stock company player to nascent movie star, establishing the scrappy underdog persona that would define her career.

        <div class="content-medium">
        <p>For the next year, the trade press buzzed with rumors that Pickford would leave Adolph Zukor's Famous Players. An unnamed company was reported to have offered her $6,000 a week. But in January 1916, <i>Motion Picture News</i> confirmed that Pickford had in fact signed a lucrative contract with Famous Players. The contract included the formation of the Mary Pickford Film Company and a new distribution concern, Artcraft Pictures Corporation, both under the auspices of Famous Players. Pickford reportedly doubled her weekly salary in 1915, and by 1916, she had negotiated for $10,000 a week and 50% of her film profits.</p></div>
        
        
        <h2>A Company of Her Own</h2>
        <div class="content-medium">
        <p>The 1916 arrangement reveals Pickford's sophisticated understanding of film production as a system of interlocking decisions. Having starred in twenty-two features in two and a half years, as Kevin Brownlow notes, she cut her output down to six films annually and established a regular team of creative collaborators, including screenwriter Frances Marion.</p>
        
        <p>Terry Ramsaye's account of the 1916 negotiations, as discussed by Brownlow, positions Pickford as "a canny negotiator" whose deal-making prowess matched Zukor's business acumen. The creation of her own studio and a distribution company for her films represented parallel structures of control. While Zukor's Famous Players-Lasky purchase of Paramount Pictures Corporation would eventually create a vertically-integrated behemoth, Pickford had secured her creative autonomy within that emerging system.</p>
        
        <p>Schmidt, writing for the Women Film Pioneers Project, emphasizes that Pickford "would sign off on every aspect of her productions, from the script to the director," and "was even known to have a hand in editing." These weren't ceremonial privileges but active exercises of authority. During these peak creative years, she produced and starred in <a href="../database/film/the-poor-little-rich-girl-1917" class="film-title">The Poor Little Rich Girl</a>, <a href="../database/film/rebecca-of-sunnybrook-farm-1917" class="film-title">Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm</a>, A Little Princess, Amarilly of Clothesline Alley, and How Could You, Jean?, all adapted from the stories of American women writers.</p>
