            <p class="hero__subtitle">How the Queen of the Movies chose women's
                stories to build her empire</p>

            <div class="hero__intro">
                <p>Between 1910 and 1927, Mary Pickford starred in <strong>17
                        films</strong> adapted from
                    <strong>13 authors</strong> whose works spanned from
                    Victorian melodramas to contemporary bestsellers.
                    After her knockout performance in Grace Miller White's <em
                        class="work-title">Tess of the Storm Country</em>
                    (1914), Pickford leveraged her unprecedented popularity to
                    become a producer who chose her own material.
                </p>
                <p>What emerges from examining these adaptations is more than a
                    filmography—it's a blueprint for how Hollywood's most
                    powerful
                    silent actress used women's literature to build her
                    multimedia stardom.</p>

            <h2>From Gaslight to Spotlight: Pickford's Literary Timeline</h2>

            <div class="content-medium">
                <p>Mary Pickford's seventeen adaptations span an extraordinary
                    fifty years of American women's literature—from
                    Frances Hodgson Burnett's <a
                        href="../database/work/esmeralda"
                        class="work-title">Esmeralda</a> (1877) to Kathleen
                    Norris's
                    <a href="../database/work/my-best-girl"
                        class="work-title">My Best Girl</a> (published and
                    filmed in 1927). But the pattern of her choices
                    reveals something more intriguing than mere range: Pickford
                    was consciously positioning herself as a bridge
                    between the Victorian stage traditions that trained her and
                    the modern medium she was helping to invent.
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <div class="viz viz--tall" id="publicationTimelineViz">
                        <!-- Timeline visualization showing publication dates vs. adaptation dates -->

                        The temporal spread of Pickford's source material, from
                        Victorian novels to contemporary bestsellers.
                        Notice how she reached both backward to 1870s melodrama
                        and forward to stories published the same year
                        as filming.
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>Consider the arithmetic of nostalgia: When Pickford starred
                    in <em class="film-title">Little Lord Fauntleroy</em>
                    in 1921, she was adapting a 36-year-old novel. Played dual
                    roles as both Cedric and his mother "Dearest,"
                    she was a 29-year-old woman channeling the 1880s for 1920s
                    audiences. This wasn't arbitrary—it was strategy.</p>

                <h3>The Burnett Quartet</h3>
                <p>The Burnett adaptations stand as the most obvious example of
                    this Victorian preference. Between 1915 and 1921,
                    Pickford returned to Frances Hodgson Burnett's work four
                    times, twice as producer:</p>

                <h3>Seizing the Contemporary Moment</h3>
                <p>But Pickford was equally adept at seizing the contemporary
                    moment. The same year she produced
                    <em class="film-title">A Little Princess</em> from 1887, she
                    grabbed Eleanor Hoyt Brainerd's
                    <em class="work-title">How Could You, Jean?</em> just one
                    year after its 1917 publication. Most remarkably,
                    she filmed <em class="film-title">The Eagle's Mate</em> and
                    <em class="film-title">My Best Girl</em> in the
                    same years they were published (1914 and 1927
                    respectively)—suggesting she or her team were reading
                    galleys,
                    following serializations, or had insider publishing
                    knowledge. [REVISE THAT SENTENCE]

                    <p>[something here]</p>
                </div>

                <p>This dual strategy—Victorian sentiment and contemporary
                    currency—positioned Pickford uniquely. She wasn't
                    just adapting books; she was managing time itself, bringing
                    forward what was worth preserving from the past
                    while grabbing what mattered from the present.</p>
