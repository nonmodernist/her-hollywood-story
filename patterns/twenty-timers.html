                couldn't stop adapting</p>

            <div class="hero__intro">
                <p>Between 1914 and 1961, these five writers saw their prose and
                    verse fiction
                    adapted to film at least twenty times each. Together, they
                    account for <strong>136 films</strong> in the database —
                    more than
                    10% of all Hollywood adaptations from American women writers
                    during
                    this period.</p>
                <p>Each author carved out a distinct niche in Hollywood:
                    Rinehart's mysteries and comedies,
                    Hurst's tearjerking melodramas, Ferber's sweeping American
                    epics, Miller's sophisticated comedies,
                    and Stratton-Porter's nature-infused romances. Understanding
                    their specializations reveals how
                    the studio system relied on proven formulas from trusted
                    storytellers.</p>

                <p>The Twenty-Timers Club represents an extraordinary
                    concentration of Hollywood's adaptation activity.
                    While <strong>493 American women writers</strong> had their
                    works adapted for film between 1910 and 1963,
                    the vast majority—<strong>305 authors (61.9%)</strong>—saw
                    only one of their works reach the screen.</p>

                <p>This makes the Twenty-Timers' dominance all the more
                    remarkable: <strong>just 5 authors (1% of all adapted
                        writers)
                        generated 136 films (12% of all adaptations)</strong>
                    from American women's literature. Put another way,
                    you were more likely to have <em>no</em> film adaptations
                    than to join this exclusive club.</p>

                        total,
                        with the silent era (1910s–1920s) accounting for about
                        half
                        of the 125 films. The sustained production through the
                        1950s
                        demonstrates these authors' enduring appeal across
                        multiple
                        generations of moviegoers.

            <h3>Silent Era Dominance</h3>
            <div class="content-medium">
                <p>72 of the 136 films were silent, with Mary Roberts Rinehart
                    alone contributing 31 silent films—
                    an astonishing 43% of all Twenty-Timer silent productions.
                    The transition
                    to talkies didn't slow the Twenty-Timers down—it opened new
                    opportunities for remakes
                    and allowed their dialogue-rich stories to shine.</p>

            <h3>The 1910s Launch</h3>
            <div class="content-medium">
                <p>The 1910s saw an incredible 40 Twenty-Timer films, with
                    Rinehart leading the charge at 17.
                    This decade established the template for literary adaptation
                    that would dominate Hollywood
                    for the next half-century.</p>
