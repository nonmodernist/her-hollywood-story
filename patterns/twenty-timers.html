                couldn't stop adapting</p>

            <div class="hero-intro">
                <p>Between 1915 and 1961, these five writers saw their works
                    adapted to film at least twenty times each. Together, they
                    account for <strong>125 films</strong> in the database—over
                    10% of all
                    Hollywood adaptations from American women writers during
                    this period.</p>
                <p>These women weren't just popular authors; they were among
                    Hollywood's most reliable hitmakers. Understanding their
                    dominance reveals how the studio system sought relationships
                    with proven storytellers who brought literary star power to
                    the screen.</p>

                    the remarkable longevity of their appeal. Mary Roberts
                    Rinehart's 44-year span (1915–1959) represents the longest
                    continuous adaptation period, while the clustering of start

        <!-- Methodology Notes -->
        <section class="methodology-notes">
            <h2>About This Data</h2>
            <div class="methodology-content">
                <h3>How We Count</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Only American film productions
                        adapted from novels, short stories, and occasionally
                        poems by American women writers (1910-1963)</li>
                    <li><strong>Excluded:</strong> British productions,
                        foreign-language versions (though noted when
                        significant), adaptations from plays, and films based on
                        works by non-American authors</li>
                    <li><strong>Twenty-Timer threshold:</strong> Authors with 20
                        or more American film adaptations from their prose
                        fiction or verse</li>
                    <li><strong>Silent era defined:</strong> Films released
                        before 1930 are counted as silent films</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Studio Attribution</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Primary credit:</strong> We use the producing
                        studio rather than distributor when both are listed</li>
                    <li><strong>Studio evolution:</strong> Famous Players-Lasky
                        and Paramount are tracked separately despite the company
                        evolution, as the merger represents a significant
                        industry shift</li>
                    <li><strong>Subsidiary relationships:</strong> Films from
                        First National (later Warner Bros) are credited to the
                        subsidiary when that was the primary production entity
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Data Decisions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Remake counting:</strong> Each new film version
                        counts as a separate adaptation, even if from the same
                        source work</li>
                    <li><strong>Attribution conflicts:</strong> When sources
                        disagree, we prioritize AFI Catalog data, followed by
                        contemporary trade publications</li>
                    <li><strong>Edge cases:</strong> Alice Duer Miller's
                        foreign-language versions at Paramount are noted but not
                        included in her count of 22 American productions</li>
                </ul>
