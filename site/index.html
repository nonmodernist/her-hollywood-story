                Between 1910 and the early 1960s, Hollywood adapted over <strong>1,100 films</strong> from novels and stories by American women. 
                These weren't occasional adaptations — they were the backbone of the studio system. Yet today, most of these writers have vanished from memory.

                <p>
                    This project began with a simple observation: while researching Gene Stratton-Porter and Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, 
                    I kept finding Hollywood adaptations of their work. As I dug deeper, a pattern emerged — American women writers were 
                    <em>everywhere</em> in early Hollywood, yet their names had largely vanished from film history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What started as casual note-taking evolved into systematic documentation of this forgotten chapter of cinema. 
                    These women didn't just contribute occasionally — they provided the stories that built Hollywood.
