        <section class="methodology-notes">
            <h2>About This Data</h2>
            <div class="methodology-content">
                <h3>How We Count</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Only American film productions adapted from novels, short stories, and occasionally poems by American women writers (1910-1963)</li>
                    <li><strong>Excluded:</strong> British productions, foreign-language versions (though noted when significant), adaptations from plays, and films based on works by non-American authors</li>
                    <li><strong>Twenty-Timer threshold:</strong> Authors with 20 or more American film adaptations from their prose fiction</li>
                    <li><strong>Silent era defined:</strong> Films released before 1930 are counted as silent films</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Studio Attribution</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Primary credit:</strong> We use the producing studio rather than distributor when both are listed</li>
                    <li><strong>Studio evolution:</strong> Famous Players-Lasky and Paramount are tracked separately despite the company evolution, as the merger represents a significant industry shift</li>
                    <li><strong>Author-owned studios:</strong> Gene Stratton Porter Productions is counted as a distinct entity to highlight author control</li>
                    <li><strong>Subsidiary relationships:</strong> Films from Cosmopolitan Productions (Hearst) and First National (later Warner Bros) are credited to the subsidiary when that was the primary production entity</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Data Decisions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Remake counting:</strong> Each new film version counts as a separate adaptation, even if from the same source work</li>
                    <li><strong>Serial films:</strong> Multi-part serials released in the same year count as one film</li>
                    <li><strong>Attribution conflicts:</strong> When sources disagree, we prioritize AFI Catalog data, followed by contemporary trade publications</li>
                    <li><strong>Edge cases:</strong> Alice Duer Miller's foreign-language versions at Paramount are noted but not included in her count of 22 American productions</li>
                </ul>
